# Inside. (Powered by BaseLayer Coach) 🏋️‍♂️🧠
> A Full-Stack, AI-Powered Fitness and Nutrition Platform (Web & Native Android)

**Inside** is a comprehensive fitness application designed to act as a personalized, AI-driven personal trainer. Users can onboard with their specific physical metrics and goals, and the application dynamically generates customized workout splits and calculated diet plans. 

To ensure maximum accessibility, the platform is fully responsive on the web and compiled as a native Android application using Capacitor.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I built this project because I was tired of generic fitness apps that forced me into cookie-cutter routines. I wanted a highly specialized, personalized tool built specifically for my body, my dietary preferences, and my goals. Instead of adapting to another app's rigid structure, I engineered a platform that adapts to *me*—complete with a custom AI coach to guide my progress every single day.
